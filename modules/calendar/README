ko3-calendar is a calendar module for Kohana 3
----

This module takes advantage of code originally written by David Walsh < http://davidwalsh.name > - Thanks David!

Documentation and usage examples will be forthcoming.

Public testing, use, and development is encouraged, but test thoroughly for any critical applications.

The function:
fetchCalendar($events)

The structure of $events[]:
$events['$eventDayOfMonth'] = array( 'url' => $eventUrl, 'title' => $eventTitle );

The output:
An HTML calendar w/ linked events. Style to taste.
